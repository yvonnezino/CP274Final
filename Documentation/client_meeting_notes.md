Plans:
- DB and display stuff working
- not now: live data
- download data set

- import Excel files

- Data files have a ton a data you don't need
  - concerned about volume of data
  - only interested in a few columns

Recommendation: use the database querying power

Talked about CSV, databases

Suggestion: division of labor

For tomorrow: A plan for the project -> goals, speculation about challenges
