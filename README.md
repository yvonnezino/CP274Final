# CP274Final

For our final project we decided we wanted to work with visualizing databases in JavaFX. We thought working in
a contracting setting for the CDC to create a program that viuslly shows data changes in COVID-19 cases, deaths, and recovered.
We wanted to use realtie data as its uploaded form the CDC to update our database and create a real time COVID-19 tracker program.

Main Goals:

-Get to know javafx better

  -Work with line graphs and charts
  
-Be able to connect the database to the requests from the javafx page

-Figure out what javafx feature would be useful and interesting for the user to have access to

-Biggest challenge: Figuring out how to update our database as new data is put out

Less Important Goals:

-Figure out how to access our large data set without having it in our repository
