# CP274Final

What to use for: 

This gives the total number of COVID cases and deaths based on the county of the United States the user looks up. Linegraphs and pie charts will better help visualize the how the virus has progressed in the county over time. 

How to Use:

The libraries needed for this program are javafx, sqlite-jdcb, and unirest. The junit-jupiter library is needed to run the unit tests. Run this from the main class. When the window pops up type a state and a county for the data you would like to examine and click the search button. 

Our original Goals:

For our final project we decided we wanted to work with visualizing databases in JavaFX. We thought working in
a contracting setting for the CDC to create a program that viuslly shows data changes in COVID-19 cases, deaths, and recovered.
We wanted to use realtie data as its uploaded form the CDC to update our database and create a real time COVID-19 tracker program.

Main Goals:

-Get to know javafx better

  -Work with line graphs and charts
  
-Be able to connect the database to the requests from the javafx page

-Figure out what javafx feature would be useful and interesting for the user to have access to

-Biggest challenge: Figuring out how to update our database as new data is put out

Less Important Goals:

-Figure out how to access our large data set without having it in our repository
